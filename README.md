# Android Weather App



This android apps goal in creation was to read from an API, process the data accordingly that it was getting from it and show the user the weather in a 24 hour cycle for that day. 


Functionality that it is missing is the ability to futher expand on the information shown when the user clicks on a card, as well as being able to check the weather for a few days ahead (possibly a whole month with various levels of accuracy depending on the data forwarded).
